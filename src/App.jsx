//TO DO:

//Navbar changes:
//When the page is viewed in half, then make the Navbar closer.
//Make the Navbar Navigate
//Change the Logo to look better -v
//Make an icon the icon for the tab 
//Call the tab your name -v
//Replace the "Hire Me" button to have 4 buttons, one for email, one for github and one for linkedIn, and link them to those

//Hero changes:
//All done

//Who changes:
//Headline "About Me"
//Maybe add a picture of yourself
//Personal Statement with background Information, What do I do outside of coding

//Works:
//

//Contact changes:
//Add subject to contact
//Add "Built and designed by Siri Hegde. All rights reserved. Â©" at the bottom of the page.
//Hook the Send button on the Contact Me to my email inbox

//TO DO:
//I've finished the Hero.jsx, the Who and Works are only set up with no images.
//The Works needs fixing, the animation won't work
//The Contact page needs fixing, the map doesn't appear 
//Time: 43:00, with exceptions :)


//Write up github repo README like gazi
